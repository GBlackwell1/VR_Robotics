# VR_Robotics
 
## Current Features
- Basic stuff has been added: <br />
o You can move the robot, the current system only does well with small movements<br />
o You can reset the robot ( though it doesn't really work :( )<br />
o Hovering over pivots shows a little interactable bubble, which moves the respective pivot<br />
o Buttons on the left work to perform actions on the robot<br />

## Current problems
- Movement system is jankity<br />
o The movements need to be normalized<br />
o I snap the pivot to a certain point after a while, side effect of movment not being normalized<br />
o Resetting the robot just doesn't work lol, he goes cray cray<br />
- Sometimes the buttons should be disabled or the robot should be not interactable but it still is

## Close next steps
- Getting gaze information from the headset
- Integration with firebase, (e.g. time when user presses a button)
- Making the laser different
